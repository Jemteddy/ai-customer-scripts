  "description": "This model returns a list of entities recognized in text. The 18 types of named entities recognized use the same output class as in [OntoNotes5|https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19] which is commonly used for benchamrking this task in academia. Please see AI Fabric documentation for detailed explanation of these 18 output classes. The model is based on the paper \"Approaching nested named entity recognition with parallel LSTM-CRFs\" by Borchmann et al, 2018. It achieves an F1 score of 93.18 on the dataset Conll-2003.
